# keras-model-editor
Web editor for Keras models.

Use it at [neurals-ro](https://neurals-ro.github.io/keras-model-editor/) GitHub page.

# How to use
Copy your own models.json by pressing the upper-left button. Or just play with the loaded source. After changes copy the code to be imported with [Keras] (https://keras.io).

## Known Bugs
Mixes default values with empty variables. But editing the source for each layer can be used as workaround.

## We would love to know how to improve this
This is in pre-pre-alpha stage but still usable. Let us know what features you would like to see in version 1.
